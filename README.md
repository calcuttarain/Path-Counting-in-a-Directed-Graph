# Path Counting in a Directed Graph Using Assembly Language

This project implements an algorithm in assembly language to count the number of paths of a given length between two nodes in a directed graph. The assembly code provided calculates the number of paths of length `k` between two nodes in a directed graph.

## Code Structure:

The main function of the code is `matrix_mult`, which performs matrix multiplication to determine the number of paths between nodes. The algorithm uses nested loops to iterate over the matrix elements, updating intermediate results as it progresses.


## Implementation Details:

- Language: Assembly x86
- Syntax: AT&T
- Bitness: 32-bit

## Future Improvements:

Currently, the code uses a fixed-size matrix to represent the graph. A potential improvement would be to dynamically allocate memory for the matrix, allowing for graphs of arbitrary size to be processed.
